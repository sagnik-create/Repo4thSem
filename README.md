# Web3 Online Game - Built with JavaScript & Godot

## Overview

Welcome to **JS Knights Game**, a Web3-powered online game built using **JavaScript** and **Godot**. This game integrates blockchain technology through **Educhain**, an EVM-compatible blockchain, ensuring secure and verifiable game progress using smart contracts.

## Features

- **2D Adventure Gameplay**: Engaging levels designed to test your skills.
- **Web3 Integration**: Smart contracts verify game progress on-chain.
- **Educhain Token Integration**: The game utilizes Educhain for transactions and progress tracking.
- **JavaScript-Godot Bridge**: A custom JavaScript script acts as a bridge between the game and the blockchain.
- **Blockchain-Based Achievements**: Your progress is immutably recorded on-chain.

## How It Works

1. **Start Playing**: Jump into the game and complete levels.
2. **Earn Rewards**: Progress is recorded when milestones are reached.
3. **Verification via Educhain**: A JavaScript script interacts with the smart contract to verify achievements.
4. **On-Chain Progress Storage**: Your game completion status is stored securely on Educhain.

## Technical Stack

- **Godot**: Game development engine.
- **JavaScript**: Facilitates communication between the game and blockchain.
- **Educhain**: EVM-compatible blockchain used for progress verification.
- **Smart Contracts**: Written in Solidity to store and verify game data.

## Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
